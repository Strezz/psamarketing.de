                <div class="agb-block">
                    <p>Our general terms and conditions apply exclusively. If these do not contain any regulations, the law applies. We do not recognize any terms and conditions of the contractual partner that contradict or deviate from our general terms and conditions or the law to our disadvantage, unless we have expressly agreed to their validity in writing. Our general terms and conditions also apply if our contractual services are provided without reservation in the knowledge that the contractual partner's terms and conditions conflict with or deviate from our general terms and conditions or to our disadvantage.</p>
                    <p>Our general terms and conditions also apply to all future business with the contractual partner.</p>
                    <p>Our general terms and conditions only apply to entrepreneurs, legal entities under public law or special funds under public law within the meaning of Section 310 (1) BGB.</p>
                    <p>Unless otherwise agreed, the regulations of §§ 611 ff BGB apply to our services.</p>
                    <p>The subject of the contract are the agreed services and not a specific economic success.</p>
                    <p>We are entitled to grant sub-power of attorney to third parties or use subcontractors.</p>
                    <p>All offers, placing of orders and subject matter will be finalized in a contract.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="agb-block">
                    <p>Our offers and quotations are - unless expressly designated as fixed - subject to change and non-binding. Appointments booked by the contractual partner are fixed and binding.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="agb-block">
                    <p>We reserve all rights to all offer and contract documents, in particular drafts, drawings, images, etc. as well as samples, models and prototypes, insofar as they are not granted to the contractual partner in accordance with the meaning and purpose of the contract or on the basis of an express agreement. Offer documents as well as samples, models and prototypes are to be returned to us immediately at our request if the order is not placed with us. The contractual partner cannot assert a right of retention in this regard.</p>
                    <p>We endeavor to take into account a change request made by the contractual partner after the conclusion of the contract with regard to the contractual services, insofar as this is reasonable for us within the scope of our operational efficiency.</p>
                    <p>The basis of the business relationship is the respective consulting contract or the order of the contractual partner to us, in which the scope of services and the remuneration are recorded. We provide our services in accordance with the contractual agreements with the diligence of a prudent businessman and always based on the individual situation and the needs of the contractual partner. Our performance is based on cooperation and mutual trust. Our performance is a free, active and self-responsible process and a certain success cannot be guaranteed. The contract partner should therefore be ready and open to deal with himself and his situation and to change personally. The contractual partner is fully responsible for his or her physical and mental health. All measures that the contractual partner takes on the basis of our services are his own area of ​​responsibility.</p>
                    <p>2.5. The contract partner receives an order confirmation after receipt of the order. With this confirmation of order, the order is deemed to have been accepted and the consulting contract to have been concluded. This order confirmation is decisive for the performance date.</p>
                    <p>2.6. As far as agreed or necessary, we consult third parties whom we have known through many years of cooperation. In these cases, the business relationship continues to exist between us and the contractual partner, unless otherwise agreed.</p>
                    <p>2.7. Updates and changes to offers and orders are specified in writing by both parties and are part of the contractual relationship between us and the contractual partner as an additional agreement.</p>

                <div class="agb-block">
                    <p>We reserve the right to increase our prices appropriately if cost increases for which we are not responsible arise after the conclusion of the contract. We will provide evidence of this to the contractual partner upon request.</p>
                    <p>Unless otherwise agreed, our prices are exclusive of any additional costs such as travel costs, postage, shipping, freight, packaging, insurance. Value added tax will be invoiced additionally at the statutory rate. If the activity is continued beyond the agreed scope, we bill according to the expenditure.
